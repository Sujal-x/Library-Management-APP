## 💡 Tips

### Represent Classes Clearly (School-Oriented)

Always include **class + section or stream** in the Class field:

- `01-A` → Class 1, Section A  
- `05-Rose` → Class 5, Rose section  
- `11-SCI` → Class 11, Science stream  
- `12-COM` → Class 12, Commerce stream  

This avoids ambiguity when the same roll numbers exist across section
