# 🛠️ First-Time Setup Guide

This guide covers the **one-time initialization** required before the system can be used.

Follow the steps below **in the given order**.

---

## 1️⃣ Launch the Application
Start the application and wait for the **Main Menu** to appear.

---

## 2️⃣ Access the Admin Menu
- Select **ADMIN** from the Main Menu  
- Enter the administrator password  

(Default password is "1234")

---

## 3️⃣ Create the Database
- Choose **CREATE DATABASE**
- When prompted:

> Do you want to load DEMO DATA? (Y/N)

**Explanation:**
- **YES** — Loads sample records for testing and familiarization  
- **NO** — Creates an empty database (recommended for live use)

This prompt is shown **only during the first setup**.

---

## 4️⃣ Exit Admin Menu
After database creation completes, return to the Main Menu.

---

## 5️⃣ System Ready
The system is now initialized and ready for normal operation.

---

## ⚠️ Important Note
The system will not function correctly until the database has been created.

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting
If initialization fails or data becomes inconsistent:
- Restore from a backup, or  
- Recreate the database from the Admin menu
