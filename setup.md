# 🛠️ First-Time Setup Guide

Follow these steps **in order** when using the software for the first time.

---

## STEP 1️⃣ Start the Application
Run the program. You will see the **Main Menu**.

---

## STEP 2️⃣ Open Admin Menu
- Choose **ADMIN**
- Enter the admin password

(Default password is provided by the administrator)

---

## STEP 3️⃣ Create Database
- Select **CREATE DATABASE**
- The system will ask:

> Do you want to load DEMO DATA? (Y/N)

### What does this mean?
- **YES** → Sample books, members, and transactions will be added
- **NO** → Empty database (recommended for real use)

⚠️ This question is asked **only once**.

---

## STEP 4️⃣ Exit Admin Menu
Once database is created, return to main menu.

---

## STEP 5️⃣ Start Using the System
You can now:
- Add books
- Add members
- Issue and return books
- Generate reports

---

## ❌ Common mistake
Trying to use the system **without creating database** first.

---

## ✅ Tip
If something goes wrong, ask admin to:
- Restore backup
- Recreate database
